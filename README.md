# Climate Crisis: Analyzing Global Temperature Changes (1990-2018)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical global and regional temperature data alongside CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2018. Our goal is to understand the trends in CO2 emissions, examine their impact on global temperature rise, and predict potential future temperature changes. The analysis helps illustrate the significant relationship between industrial pollutants and regional/global temperature patterns.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Analyze historical CO2 emissions and temperature trends.
- Explore regional disparities in temperature changes.
- Evaluate the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature rise across different regions.

## Key Findings
1. **Global and Regional Emission Trends**  
   From 1990 to 2018, CO2 emissions increased by more than 60%, with Asia (primarily China and India) being the largest contributors. Despite efforts to curb emissions in regions like Europe and North America, global levels continued to rise due to ongoing reliance on fossil fuels.

2. **Global Temperature Trends**  
   Over the same period, global temperatures rose by approximately 0.6-0.7Â°C. The Arctic region saw the fastest warming, with temperatures rising over twice the global average, whereas other regions experienced varying degrees of temperature increase.

3. **Temperature vs. CO2 Emissions Correlation**  
   A significant positive correlation exists between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, with regions like the Arctic and Asia showing the strongest relationships. However, some regions with mitigation policies, like the EU, showed weaker correlations.

## Limitations
- **Data Gaps:** Incomplete or inconsistent data availability for certain regions and time periods may affect the precision of the analysis.
- **Exclusion of Other Factors:** This study primarily focuses on CO2 emissions and does not fully account for other pollutants or natural climate variability.
- **Assumption of Linearity:** The analysis assumes a linear relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, potentially overlooking complex climate feedback mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for data visualization and hosting the analysis results.
- **Plotly** for creating interactive visualizations, including:
  - Global CO2 Emissions (1990-2018)
  - Global Temperature Change in 2020 (Choropleth map)
