Objective
---------
The main objective of this project is to explore historical temperature data and pollutant emissions, analyze trends over time, and predict future temperature changes driven by climate change across different regions. By focusing on CO2 emissions, we aim to understand their direct impact on regional temperature patterns and the broader global climate system.

Key Research Questions
------------------------
Global and Regional Emission Trends:

- Question: How have global CO2 emissions changed over the last decades (1990-2018)? How do CO2 emissions vary by region, and which regions are contributing the most to global emissions?

- Answer: 
Over the last few decades, global CO2 emissions have risen significantly, driven primarily by industrial growth, increased energy consumption, and deforestation. From 1990 to 2018, the world saw a steady rise in CO2 emissions, though the rate of increase varied depending on region and development patterns. 
CO2 emissions vary widely across regions, reflecting differences in industrial activity, energy use, population size, and environmental policies.

1990s: CO2 emissions were relatively stable but showed early signs of increasing due to industrialization in developing countries, especially China and India. Developed countries continued to emit heavily, though some regions like Europe began implementing more stringent environmental regulations.

2000s-2010s: The steepest rise occurred in this period. Major industrialization in emerging economies, particularly in Asia, contributed to the surge. The global financial crisis of 2008 caused a brief dip, but emissions quickly rebounded in the following years.

2018: By 2018, global CO2 emissions had risen by more than 60% from 1990 levels. Despite growing awareness of climate change and efforts to reduce emissions, global trends continue to climb due to ongoing fossil fuel reliance, especially in power generation and transportation sectors.
Global and Regional Temperature Trends:
Question: How has global temperature changed over the last decades? How do temperature changes vary by region?

Answer: 

Over the last several decades, the Earth has experienced a steady and significant rise in global temperatures, largely attributed to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, particularly CO2, in the atmosphere. Here's how global temperature changes unfolded:
Early 1990s: Temperatures were already beginning to rise, with the decade being one of the warmest on record at the time. However, the pace of warming accelerated rapidly after this period.
2000s: This decade marked a distinct turning point, with several of the warmest years ever recorded, largely driven by the increasing CO2 emissions from industrial activities. The global average temperature increase from pre-industrial levels surpassed 0.8°C by the end of this decade.
2010s to 2018: The 2010s were the hottest decade ever recorded, with 2016 being the hottest single year on record globally. By 2018, the global temperature rise had reached about 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels, inching closer to the 1.5°C threshold set by the Paris Agreement. The warming trend continues, with higher-than-average temperatures observed globally.

While the global average temperature has increased, regional temperature changes vary significantly due to geographical, environmental, and climatic factors. Some regions are warming at a faster pace than others.
In summary, from 1990 to 2018, global temperatures increased by approximately 0.6-0.7°C, with the warming accelerating notably in the 2000s and 2010s. This rise is closely linked to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrialization.
Temperature vs. Emissions
Question: How have global and regional temperature patterns changed in response to varying levels of CO2 emissions over the past century?

Answer: 

Between 1990 and 2018, the Earth experienced significant warming, with global temperatures rising by approximately 0.6°C to 0.7°C. During this period, CO2 emissions increased sharply, driven by economic growth, industrialization, and energy consumption. The correlation between CO2 emissions and global temperature rise became more pronounced during these decades.

1990s: This decade saw steady increases in global temperatures, driven by rising emissions from fossil fuel combustion, particularly in industrialized nations. By the end of the decade, temperatures were about 0.4°C above pre-industrial levels.

2000s: The 2000s experienced a more accelerated warming, with the decade ranking among the warmest on record at the time. Temperatures by 2010 were approximately 0.6°C above pre-industrial levels, aligning with increased CO2  concentrations.

2010-2018: This period included some of the warmest years on record, including 2016, which was the hottest single year globally. By 2018, temperatures had risen by 1°C above pre-industrial levels.
Regional temperature changes during this period varied, with uneven warming across different parts of the world. CO2  emissions and temperature rise were strongly correlated, though the strength of this correlation varied by region:
Arctic and Polar Regions:
The Arctic warmed at more than 2 to 3 times the global average, with temperatures rising by over 2°C between 1990 and 2018. This rapid warming is linked to Arctic amplification and feedback loops caused by sea ice loss.
The strong correlation between CO2  emissions and temperature rise is most evident in polar regions, where local temperature increases outpaced global averages.

Europe:

Europe experienced an average temperature rise of over 1°C by 2018, with Northern and Eastern Europe seeing the largest increases. Heatwaves became more frequent, especially during the summers of 2003 and 2018.
Despite lower CO2  emissions in some European countries due to strict environmental policies, global climate effects led to warming, showing a more complex relationship between local emissions and temperature changes.

North America:

In North America, the western U.S. and Canada saw significant temperature increases, with average rises between 1-1.5°C. The correlation between CO2  emissions and temperature rise is particularly strong in these regions, contributing to an increase in extreme weather events like wildfires and droughts.
Canada’s Arctic regions warmed rapidly, similar to other polar areas.

Asia:

Asia, particularly China and India, experienced rapid industrialization during this period, leading to soaring CO2  emissions. Temperatures increased by more than 1°C in many parts of the continent, especially in China, where rapid urbanization and deforestation played a major role.
The Pearson correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature rise was notably strong in East Asia and Southeast Asia.

Africa:

Africa’s temperature rise during 1990-2018 was more moderate compared to other regions, though Northern Africa experienced more significant warming of around 1.5°C. Desertification and droughts became more common in this period, exacerbating the impacts of climate change.
Despite relatively low CO2 emissions, some regions faced disproportionate warming due to land-use changes and climate feedback.

Latin America:

Brazil and the Amazon region saw a moderate temperature rise of around 1°C, with deforestation contributing to increased CO2 levels. However, the vast rainforest also acted as a carbon sink, leading to more localized effects on temperature rise.

Other parts of Latin America experienced less warming compared to regions like the Arctic or Europe, although heatwaves 
and extreme weather events became more frequent.

Limitations
---------------

1. Data availability: One of the main challenges in analyzing the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature rise is the incomplete or inconsistent availability of datasets across regions and time periods. Many developing countries, for example, may lack detailed historical records of emissions, and some regions may have limited temperature data prior to the mid-20th century. Moreover, inconsistent reporting standards or gaps in data collection can lead to uncertainties in the results. This data limitation can particularly skew the correlation in areas where missing information forces reliance on estimations or modeling, thus affecting the overall accuracy of the analysis.

2. Other influencing factors: While this study focuses on the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, it does not fully account for other factors that influence temperature patterns. Natural climate variability, such as volcanic eruptions, oceanic cycles like El Niño and La Niña, and solar radiation fluctuations, can significantly affect short-term and long-term temperature trends. Additionally, other pollutants, such as methane, aerosols, and particulates, can either amplify or mitigate the warming effect of CO2, complicating the relationship between emissions and temperature. By focusing solely on CO2, the study may overlook these contributing factors, which could influence regional or even global temperature changes.


3. Assumption of linearity: This study assumes a linear relationship between CO2  emissions and temperature rise, which simplifies the analysis but may not capture the complexity of climate systems. Climate dynamics involve multiple feedback loops, thresholds, and tipping points that can cause nonlinear responses to increasing CO2  levels. For example, as temperatures rise, phenomena such as permafrost thawing or the melting of polar ice could lead to accelerated warming beyond what a simple linear model would predict. By not incorporating potential nonlinearities, the analysis may miss out on key interactions or future projections that deviate from the linear trend.
Conclusions and Insights

Our analysis shows a significant positive correlation between CO2  emissions and temperature changes, supporting the hypothesis that increased emissions contribute to regional and global temperature rise.
Over the analyzed period, both CO2  emissions and temperature patterns exhibit a clear upward trend, reinforcing the argument that industrial pollutants and emissions contribute significantly to regional temperature rise. 
Global CO2  emissions have increased significantly since 1990, with Asia emerging as the dominant emitter, largely due to rapid industrialization in China and India. In contrast, regions like the European Union and North America have made notable strides in reducing emissions through policy, technology, and a shift toward renewable energy. However, as the world continues to industrialize, particularly in developing regions, managing and mitigating global CO2  emissions remains a major challenge.


Global temperatures have steadily increased over the last few decades, with an average rise of around 0.6-0.7°C from 1990 to 2018. However, this warming is not uniform across the globe. The Arctic region has experienced the most dramatic changes, warming at over twice the global average, while Europe, North America, and Australia have also seen significant warming, particularly in recent years. Conversely, some regions, like equatorial areas in Africa and South America, have seen more moderate but still impactful temperature increases. These changes are closely tied to both natural climate variability and anthropogenic factors, including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and urbanization.
The regional disparities in warming highlight the complexity of global climate change and underscore the need for region-specific strategies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures.
Globally, there is a strong positive Pearson correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, particularly over the past century. Regions like the Arctic, Asia, and parts of North America demonstrate a clear link between industrial emissions and accelerated warming. However, regional discrepancies exist in the form of weaker or negative correlations in countries that have adopted mitigation policies (e.g., the EU), regions with significant natural carbon sinks (e.g., the Amazon), or areas where natural climate variability (e.g., Siberia, the Arctic) plays a large role in moderating temperature changes.
This variability highlights the complex relationship between emissions and temperature on a regional scale, emphasizing the importance of local factors, environmental policies, and natural feedback mechanisms.




CO2 Emission vs. CO2 per Capita Emission
-----------------------------------------------


Our team used total CO2 in place of per capita because:


We are focusing on the absolute scale of emissions and want to compare the total environmental impact.
Our research aims to understand or address large-scale emissions and their contribution to global emissions.
The scale of emissions relative to population size is less important than the total quantity.


- Pros:

Provides a measure of the absolute scale of emissions. Useful for understanding overall environmental impact or comparing total emissions across regions or countries.

- Cons:

Larger populations will naturally produce more emissions, which might not provide a fair comparison of emission efficiency or impact.
